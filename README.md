# AI-Powered Research Paper Summarizer


This project presents an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool designed to automatically extract and summarize key sections—**Introduction**, **Methodology**, **Results**, and **Conclusion**—from academic research papers. Leveraging state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this tool enables researchers, students, and professionals to quickly understand the core content of complex scholarly documents.

## Features

**1. Automatic Section Detection**  
Efficiently identifies structural components of a research paper, including Introduction, Methodology, Results, and Conclusion, from both PDF and plain-text formats.

**2. Transformer-Based Summarization**  
Employs cutting-edge pre-trained language models such as Pegasus, T5, and GPT to generate coherent and contextually accurate summaries of each section.

**3. Summary Evaluation**  
Includes automatic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore to assess the quality of generated summaries.

**4. Flexible Input Support**  
Compatible with both academic PDFs and plain-text files, ensuring wide usability across different sources and formats.

**5. Modular and Extensible Design**  
Built with a clean and modular Python architecture, allowing seamless customization, integration, and enhancement for specific research or enterprise needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **NLP Libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, spaCy  
- **Summarization Models**: Pegasus, T5, GPT  
- **Evaluation Tools**: ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore (via the `evaluate` library)  
- **PDF Parsing**: PyMuPDF (fitz) or PDFMiner for reliable text extraction from academic PDFs

## Use Cases

- Rapid comprehension of lengthy and technical academic papers  
- Accelerated literature review for academic writing or research proposals  
- Productivity enhancement for students, researchers, educators, and policy analysts  
- Integration into scholarly search engines, academic platforms, or institutional research repositories

## Benefits

- Saves valuable time during the research process  
- Ensures consistency in reviewing large volumes of literature  
- Enhances accessibility to scientific knowledge by providing digestible summaries  
- Enables integration with downstream academic workflows, such as citation management and literature mapping
